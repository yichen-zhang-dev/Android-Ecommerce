# Previously Ecommerce, Currently Your List of Favorite Movies App (PECYLFMA)

PECYLFMA is an Android Mobile app, first designed as an Ecommerce app, and later changed to an app that helps you keep track of your favorite movies

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yichen-zhang-dev/Android-Ecommerce.git
```

## Usage

There are mainly two pages. The Home page displays the 77 most popular movies from IMDb. Right below each movie are two buttons -- the dislike button and the like button. Clicking on dislike will remove the movie from the list of favorite movies, and clicking on like will add a movie to the list. In the top right corner, a movie icon will take the user to their personal favorite movies. On this page, users can only remove a movie from their favorite list.

Enjoy :)
